# PHP Learning Project – Day 1 🚀

Welcome to **Day 1** of my PHP Learning Project! Today, I focused on setting up the **initial project structure**, creating the main entry file, and establishing the **database connection** for fetching data.

---

## 📝 Reasoning
- Organized folders from Day 1 to keep the project maintainable  
- `config/` and `database/` separate constants and connections for cleaner code  
- `controller/` ready for future data operations  
- `assets/` prepared for CSS, JS, and images  

---

## 🛠️ What I Did Today

### 1️⃣ Created `index.html`
- Basic HTML file as the main entry point  
- Ready for PHP integration in the next days  

### 2️⃣ Database Connection
- Defined constants in `config/database.php`  
- Connected to the database in `database/connection.php`  
- Successfully fetched data to verify the connection  

**Why:**  
- Keeping configuration and connection separate improves **reusability and readability**  
- Prepares the project for **CRUD operations** and dynamic content  

---

## ✅ Outcome
- Folder structure set up and organized  
- Database connection working  
- Data fetching from the database verified  
- Project is ready for **Day 2: form handling and validation**  

---

## 🔗 Next Steps
- Implement **user data submission forms**  
- Add **form validation**  
- Store user data in the database

**Note:** This README tracks daily progress and explains **why each setup step matters**, making it beginner-friendly.
