    # Here is our database connection related code and we will reuse this everywhere

    /*
        Q. What is require_once() and what is exactly Method or Function ?
        Ans: require_once is a function in php which is used to include php file at once.
        
        Also You should know about required() and include()
        Ans: Explore it for now we will provide more details in next day.


        Q. What is __DIR__ ?
        Ans: __DIR__ is magic constant in PHP threr are many more magic content in PHP 
        magic constant = magic contant is a special type of constant which changes their value dynamically
        in which context and its return value like here we are using __DIR__ it will return the directory where it is using.

        as __CLASS__ .... explore yourself will provide more details in next day.

            Q. What is Try? (The Most Important Note)

            Ans:
                It is a way to handle critical errors without crashing the program.
                The try block lets you *test* a block of code for errors (exceptions).
                If an exception occurs, PHP does not crash, instead it passes the error to the catch block.

            Q. How to Connect to a Database in PHP?

            Ans:
                There are mainly two ways to connect PHP with MySQL database:
                
                1. **MySQLi (MySQL Improved)**
                    - Works only with MySQL databases
                    - Two styles available:
                        a) Object-Oriented (In my code i am using this)
                        b) Procedural ()

                2. **PDO (PHP Data Objects)** (Will do in advance project stay connected.)
                    - Works with *many databases* (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, etc.)
                    - More flexible and secure
                    - Recommended for larger projects
